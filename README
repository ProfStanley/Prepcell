This is the prepcell code that was used to create the simulations in the following paper: 

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pssa.202200175

It assumes that you are using SIESTA, specifically Siesta 4.1-b4, but any version should work because the .vectors file is in the same format.

Note that the sic.xyz file is a text file that assumes the following format: x, y, z, atomic number, atomic mass (in amu)

The output of the prepcell code is the sic.XV file.  This contains all the positions and velocities (in Bohr) that will alow someone to run a simulation in SIESTA
The sic.XV file here is given as a sample output, where the equilibrium temperature of the supercell is ~350K.
